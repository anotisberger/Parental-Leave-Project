# Parental Leave Project

This is a personal project to learn data science and gain familiarity with some relevant python packages. 

### Introduction:
It seems like every day, my newsfeed is flooded with articles about the gender wage gap, the experiences of women in tech fields, and how companies are addressing issues of work-life balance. When my sister gave birth in another country, with very different maternity leave policies than the US, I began thinking about how different government policies could lead to different outcomes for women’s engagement in the workforce. In particular, one of my sister’s colleagues mentioned that in her home country, maternity leave is a full year, and as a result companies there are reluctant to hire women. This was something I hadn’t much considered before, and I thought it might be interesting to examine some data to see if there is a relationship between length of maternity leave and women’s employment rates. Of course, there are many variables and this is a complicated issue that is difficult to quantify, but I thought this was a good place to start. 

### Overview:
My project consists of a two parts (so far): 
* Part 1 - Getting Data - There are several wikipedia pages with tables of relevant data organized by country, and The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has an open database of employment data from many countries. I wanted to scrape the data from the wikipedia pages and put it into .csv files that I could then use and analyze in python. 
* Part 2 - Cleaning and combining the data into pandas dataframes and producing some plots to answer my questions about the relationship between length of maternity leave and women’s engagement in the workforce. 

### Questions for Further Investigation: 
While I was working through this project, I came up with a few more detailed questions for further investigation:
* Is there any difference in women’s engagement in the workforce in countries with more equal parental leave for both parents (not just available to mothers, or “primary caregivers”)?
* How is parental leave funded? If it is paid for by public funds rather than by the hiring company, are companies more willing to hire women of childbearing age? 
* Is there a difference in employment between countries with paid and unpaid parental leave? 
* How does all of this relate to the fertility rate? Are women more likely to have more children when there is more maternity leave, or less likely to work altogether in countries with higher fertility rates?
